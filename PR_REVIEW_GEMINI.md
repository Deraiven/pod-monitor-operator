# Code Review: Persistent Container Restart Monitoring PR

## Overall Assessment & Rating

This pull request introduces a valuable feature by adding persistent container restart monitoring. The goal of retaining historical data across operator restarts is important for reliability. The implementation correctly identifies the need for new metric types (`Counter` and a uniquely-labeled `Gauge`) to achieve this persistence in Prometheus.

However, the current implementation has several critical issues related to security, concurrency, and memory management that make it unsuitable for production environments. Additionally, the approach for event-based tracking introduces a significant risk of high cardinality, which can impact the performance and stability of the Prometheus monitoring system.

**Rating: 4/10** - A good concept with a functional-but-flawed implementation. It requires significant changes to be considered production-ready.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Must-Fix for Production)

### 1. Security: Overly Broad RBAC Permissions

The `ClusterRole` defined in `config/rbac/role.yaml` grants the operator `get`, `list`, and `watch` permissions on **all secrets in the entire cluster**.

```yaml
# config/rbac/role.yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "secrets"]  # <-- This is cluster-wide
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

This violates the principle of least privilege. The operator only needs to read the `linkerd-identity-issuer` secret in the `linkerd` namespace.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove secret permissions from the `ClusterRole`
- Create a namespaced `Role` and `RoleBinding` for the specific secret:

```yaml
# config/rbac/linkerd_secret_role.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: linkerd-secret-reader
  namespace: linkerd
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["linkerd-identity-issuer"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```

### 2. Concurrency: Race Condition on `observedRestarts` Map

The `observedRestarts` map is accessed by multiple goroutines without synchronization, causing a race condition.

**Recommendation:**
```go
var (
    observedRestarts = make(map[string]int32)
    restartsMutex    sync.RWMutex
)

// Read with RLock
restartsMutex.RLock()
observedCount := observedRestarts[containerKey]
restartsMutex.RUnlock()

// Write with Lock
restartsMutex.Lock()
observedRestarts[containerKey] = cs.RestartCount
restartsMutex.Unlock()
```

### 3. Memory Leak in `observedRestarts` Map

Deleted pods are never removed from the map, causing unbounded memory growth.

**Recommendation:**
```go
// When pod is deleted
restartsMutex.Lock()
for key := range observedRestarts {
    if strings.HasPrefix(key, fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s/", req.Namespace, req.Name)) {
        delete(observedRestarts, key)
    }
}
restartsMutex.Unlock()
```

## ðŸŸ  High-Priority Recommendations

### 1. Prometheus Metrics: High Cardinality Risk

The `pod_monitor_container_restart_events` metric creates a new time series for every restart, which can cause a "cardinality explosion" in high-churn environments.

**Problem:** Using `restart_count` as a label violates Prometheus best practices and can severely degrade performance.

**Recommendation:** Remove the event-based metric. The combination of:
- `pod_monitor_container_restart_total` (Counter) - for restart counts and rates
- `pod_monitor_container_last_termination_info` (Gauge) - for latest failure details

Provides the necessary monitoring without cardinality risks. For complete event history, use a logging solution like Loki.

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Priority Recommendations

### 1. Configuration: Hardcoded Values

The Linkerd namespace and secret name are hardcoded.

**Recommendation:** Make these configurable via environment variables or flags.

### 2. Unused CRD

The `PodMonitor` CRD exists but is not used - the controller watches all pods regardless.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Implement CRD-based pod selection with label selectors
2. Remove the CRD entirely if monitoring all pods is intended

---

## Summary

The PR introduces important functionality but has critical issues:
- **Security vulnerability** (overly broad RBAC)
- **Race condition** (unprotected map access)
- **Memory leak** (no cleanup of deleted pods)
- **Prometheus anti-pattern** (high cardinality metrics)

These must be addressed before the code is production-ready. The concept is sound, but the implementation needs significant improvements to meet production standards.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Fix critical security and concurrency issues immediately
2. Remove the high-cardinality event metric
3. Add proper tests for concurrent access patterns
4. Consider using a more robust state management approach
5. Update documentation to reflect actual behavior
